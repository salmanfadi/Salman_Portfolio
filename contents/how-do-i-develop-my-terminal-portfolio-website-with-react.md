Here are some tactics that I have read from mangas like Ao ashi and Ao ni nara.

## Defensive Ideas

When there's only one forward, a two centre-back setup works perfectly. One can mark the striker, and the other can cover. It gives a proper balance.

Keeping a fixed distance between players and forming three lines (defence, midfield, attack) makes it difficult for the opponent to progress. It's harder for them to find gaps to pass.

If a fullback pushes forward, the other three defenders should spread out slightly to cover the space left behind. That way, the shape stays intact.

Man-marking is old school, but still effective if done right. You stick to your man, apply pressure constantly, and cut off passing options. Zonal defence, though, is what most teams use now—it's all about positioning and spacing, not individual battles.

## Pressing and Tracking Back

When a team uses high pressing (gegenpressing), all eleven players press together. The ball carrier gets no space, and the passing lanes are blocked. It creates panic, and the team usually loses the ball fast.

The best counter to this is to play direct football. Use individual technique, make use of the spaces left behind, and pass accurately. You might not have high possession, but it creates goal chances quickly.

After losing the ball, the person who lost it should track back immediately for at least five seconds. This short burst can stop a counterattack and gives time for teammates to reset. Makes sense because the player who lost the ball is closest to the one who won it.

## Build-Up and Ball Movement

A DMF (defensive midfielder) who can pass well is a huge asset. They help in moving the ball from defence to attack quickly and accurately.

One centre-back with good passing ability is also important. He can trigger counters or switch plays and helps keep possession smoothly.

Receiving the ball properly is underrated. First touch matters a lot. You should stop the ball in a way that gives you more passing options. Also, before receiving, turning your neck to scan your surroundings helps you decide the next move faster.

Understanding between players is key. You don't always need to look up—if chemistry is strong, movements and passes become automatic.

## Attacking Movements and Formations

When wingbacks join the attack, the team gains numerical superiority. It forces the opponent's wingbacks to pull wide, creating space in the middle. That causes confusion and helps in building better chances.

Overlapping is when a fullback goes wide to the corner and pulls defenders out. Underlapping is when they cut inside into the box. Both are useful based on the situation.

The triangle system (fullback, midfielder, and forward on the same wing) allows players to pass in a way that can beat defenders easily.

Five-lane attack: The field is divided into five vertical zones. Players are positioned in alternate lanes, which helps in creating triangles and makes it easier to find free players. That's how fast passing and fluid attacking works.

## Examples and Observation

In a 1v1 situation with the goalkeeper, the striker shouldn't rush. The goalkeeper should stay still and delay the striker until help arrives. If the keeper moves first, a smart striker (like Lewandowski) can read the footwork and shoot in the opposite direction.

Possession-based football needs more technical players compared to counterattacking football. Teams like Guardiola's focus on individual technique and midfield control.

Even one player (usually in the backline) can keep the squad stable by shouting instructions. Since they can see the whole field, they can guide others to fill gaps or shift shape.

In compact defence, the idea is to let the opponent have the ball and press them in a specific area you've planned to trap. Once the ball is won, you immediately launch an attack with long balls or through passes. For this, communication and team movement is everything.

## Random but Cool Insights

Malicia: Tricks used to outsmart opponents. It's part of the game.

Behaving properly: Might seem obvious, but maintaining a cool head and respect on field matters.

Horizontal positioning helps in defence; vertical spacing helps in creating passing options.

One cool example was from Liverpool vs Watford—Liverpool plays aggressively, but Watford countered that by switching to a 4-5-1 with solid rules. To break that, Liverpool needed to drop back, link mid to defence, and draw Watford out.
