It was a quick decision to go to Dharamshala. As we were 5 people and only had two good bikes(The other was not good enough to ride 50km) we requested another friend.

He joined and we went to Dharamshala on 3 bikes-One Himalaya, one hunter, and a bullet. We hadn't slept the previous day. 

So we stopped in a masjid along the way and slept for a bit and we reached Mcleodganj, Dharamshala, and started looking for rooms. We got a room for 230 per person and took it. It was a good room.

At night we started foodhunting through the Mcleodganj streets. We ate some authentic momos and ate dinner(Bread omelet). The thing is that as we are students we need to decrease the expense as much as we can. 

We went to the room and slept. The next day we were planning to go to Triund. Two of us has arriers and went back to write it rest four of us started hiking Triund. 

Two of us has arriers and went back to write it rest four of us started hiking Triund. We bought ORS, Snicker bars, Bread,  Peanut butter and Jam, and a can of water. We started hiking at 3 pm. 

We feared that we would not reach there before night. As we feared it went dark fast in the mountains but before it was pitch black we managed to reach the top. 

There was a board stating the height and a stall behind it for people who booked packages. The package was 800 rupees we didn't take it obviously because of the budget and some adventure is fun. and the hard part was we were four people and we had a two-person tent but we were not there to sleep right. 

We went to the stall and joined in for the campfire there were other people from the package but we were the only ones without the package. After some time every one of them went to sleep in their tent(which has sleeping bags, we don't) except two of them.

They were solo travelers and met at the hostteler(a backpacker hostel) and planned to come to Triund. They were amazed that we were studying in college, They said that we were lucky cause they didn't anywhere before work but one of them was a crazy traveler who was traveling for one month non-stop while working online.

We were waiting for the moonlight to shine in the snow-covered Himalayas. We were not lucky we were only able to see a naive version of it. 

And then we went to sleep after I slept there was huge rain and wind and we didn't put on the waterproof layer of the tent. The water was slowly dripping inside after some time I woke up because of the dripping of water. 

After an hour they woke up too we freshened up and packed the tent. And started going down the mountain. 

After an hour and a half, we reached down where we parked our bikes and started the ride back. By evening we reached home. This was a good experience, met new people and the ride was damn good.
